/*
    The Dusty Library
    The room is lined with decaying bookshelves, and the smell of mold fills the air. Most of the books are nothing but crumbling paper now, their words lost to time. You run a hand along a dusty shelf and pick up a book whose cover has all but disintegrated. The silence in here feels heavy, as if the very walls are holding their breath.

            The Forge
    You find yourself in a dark chamber dominated by an old, cold forge. The tools lie abandoned, covered in dust and soot. An anvil sits in the center, its surface scarred from countless strikes. The smell of burnt metal lingers faintly in the air. You wonder what was crafted here, and why the forge was left to cool forever.

    The Sunken Treasury
    Water laps against your boots as you step into the flooded chamber. Chests and piles of coins glint beneath the murky water, but they are half-submerged, almost out of reach. Every ripple in the water makes you uneasy, as if something could be hiding just beneath the surface, waiting to strike.

    The Catacombs
    You move through narrow stone corridors lined with ancient, crumbling bones. The air is thick and musty, and the light barely penetrates the darkness ahead. As you turn each corner, the sound of your own breathing seems to echo louder and louder. The skeletons lying here are long dead, but the silence feels anything but peaceful.

    The Hall of Mirrors
    You step into a corridor lined with tall, polished mirrors. At first, they show your reflection, but as you walk past, the images shift. Some show you as you are, others twist your form into grotesque versions of yourself. One mirror shows nothing at all, though you’re standing right in front of it. You feel a chill run down your spine.

    The Throne Room
    The grand hall opens before you, with a cracked stone throne sitting at the far end. Vines creep along the walls, and the once-majestic banners hang in tatters. The silence is oppressive, and though the throne is empty, it feels as if the weight of forgotten rulers still presses down on this place.

    The Spider’s Nest
    As you enter the cavern, you can barely see through the thick, sticky webs that coat every surface. Your footsteps are muffled by the webbing, and you hear the faint scurrying of unseen creatures in the dark. Skeletons, wrapped in web, dangle from the ceiling, their empty eye sockets staring down at you.

            The Laboratory
    Broken glass and scattered papers litter the stone floor of the laboratory. Alchemical equipment sits abandoned on tables, and the remnants of half-finished experiments have long since grown moldy or rotten. The stench of chemicals still lingers in the air, and you can almost hear the distant voices of scholars who once worked here.

    The Crypt
    You descend into the crypt, where rows of stone sarcophagi line the walls. The air is heavy with dust, and it feels unnaturally quiet, as though the entire dungeon has fallen silent to listen. Each stone coffin is engraved with ancient runes, and the cold air sends a shiver down your spine. You feel as though the dead are restless here.

    The Firefall Cavern
    Molten lava flows through cracks in the rock, creating a dim orange glow that lights the cavern. The heat is intense, and the ground trembles faintly beneath your feet. Carefully, you navigate the narrow paths between pools of bubbling lava, mindful of every step. One wrong move, and you’ll be lost in the fire.

    The Fountain Room
    In the center of the room, a large stone fountain stands, but the water is dark and still. The statues around it depict sorrowful figures, their stone faces streaked with ancient grime. As you approach, the air feels heavy with a strange tension, and you can’t tell whether the fountain is a blessing or a curse.

    The Balcony Overlook
    You emerge onto a narrow stone balcony that overlooks a deep chasm. The drop below is dizzying, and the air is cool and thin. From here, you can see much of the dungeon’s labyrinthine design sprawling below you. A sense of isolation washes over you—if something attacks here, there’s nowhere to run.

    The Flooded Ruins
    Water sloshes around your legs as you wade through the submerged ruins. Broken pillars rise from the water, and the stone beneath your feet is slippery with moss. Strange fish dart through the murky water, disappearing before you can get a good look. Something big stirs in the depths below, making you quicken your pace.

    The Hall of Chains
    The sound of clinking metal fills the air as you step into a vast hall, where rusted chains dangle from the ceiling and walls. Some sway gently, though there’s no breeze. The echoes disorient you, making it hard to tell which way is forward. You can’t help but feel like something—or someone—is moving among the chains, just out of sight.

    The Gate Room
    At the end of a long, spiraling passage, you find an enormous stone gate carved with intricate symbols. The door is massive, almost otherworldly, and though it is closed, you feel a strange pull toward it. Whatever lies beyond is not of this world, and stepping through would mean leaving everything familiar



    behind.*/
